## 👋 Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a computational biologist and postdoctoral researcher passionate about uncovering complex disease mechanisms through integrative multi-omics and systems biology.

### 🔬 About Me

I apply network-based and multi-omics-driven systems biology approaches to study respiratory diseases such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and allergic rhinitis. My research focuses on identifying robust biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and mechanistic insights by integrating transcriptome, microbiome, and proteome data.
