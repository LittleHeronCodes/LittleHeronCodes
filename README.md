## 👋 Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a bioinformatics researcher interested in studying disease mechanisms through integrated multi-omics analysis

### 🔬 About Me

I apply network-based and multi-omics-driven systems biology approaches to study respiratory diseases such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and allergic rhinitis. My research focuses on discovering mechanistic insights through systems biology approach.
